# WebSocket Project

This project demonstrates a real-time communication system using WebSockets, consisting of a frontend client and a backend server.

## Project Structure

- `websocket-app-frontend-client/` - React TypeScript frontend application
- `websockets-code-backend-server/` - TypeScript WebSocket server

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd websocket-app-frontend-client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd websockets-code-backend-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To make it work through github codespaces you can also do that, First run the backend setup and then in the url for port 8080 there is the url redirected to some VM url, copy this new url and paste it in frontend server url and then just follow the steps mentioned above.
